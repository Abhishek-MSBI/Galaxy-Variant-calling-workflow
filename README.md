 A comprehensive Galaxy workflow for annotating and filtering genetic variants (SNPs and InDels) from VCF files using SnpEff and SnpSift. This workflow predicts functional impacts of variants and filters them based on impact severity and quality metrics to identify biologically significant mutations.
